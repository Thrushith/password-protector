# password-protector
This is a python program that is used to encrypt the passwords so that the third person cannot know it until the key is provided , this is not the very best method for the protection of your passwords but is one of the easiest and most efficient one.

<h1><b>To-know</b></h1>
-> When you run the program it asks for the password or the KEY and that is "password".<br><br>
-> You can also change the password in the program itself in the variable known as "key_pass".<br><br>
-> After entering the correct password it asks you whether you want to add a password into it or to view the existing ones.<br><br>
<p aliign="right">-> After adding new passwords a new ".txt" file gets created and in that there will the passwords that you have added but instead in an encrypted way to decrypt them you 
     need to run the program and enter the correct "key_pass".</p><br>
-> Viewing the ".txt" file will show the decrypted passwords, and this can be done when you know the "key_pass".<br> <br>
